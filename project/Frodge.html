            <h3>Context: INFO 360 Design Methods</h3>
            <h3>Duration: 11 weeks</h3>
            <h3>Collaboration: Member of 3-person team</h3>
            <p>I followed the Design process from user research to high-fidelity mockups, 
                over 11 weeks with my 3-student team. Our problem space was on food waste in the home of the future.
                And our user group would be the residents/homeowners cooking in their homes. Interviews were conducted,
                user personas created, and reseaerch was done to understand the problem space and help us define the 
                problem space. We prototyped and ideated till we found our selling idea: Frodge. Frodge is a 
                smart fridge that'll help any user reduce their fod waste. We created a video mock-up and designed 
                panel screens to show to our users. We conducted usability testing to help us refine our idea and 
                identify painpoints in our idea. This process culminated in a final prototype of Frodge.</p>

                <h2>Design Space</h2>
                <p>Before ideating and deisgning a product, we conducted some research and user interviews within the food waste 
                area. First identifying and exploring our design space, which is food waste in the home. Second, identify stakeholders.
                And lastly, conducting context studies with our stakeholders. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Research
                </h4>
                <p>
                    When diving into our design space, we established a few research questions to guide us through
                    the large design space. These questions will reveal more information about the problems we face
                    and will help us be more informed throughout the design process. 

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Where does food waste occur?
                        <p>Food waste can occur at any point in the food production cycle from the
                            farmers, to retailers, and even to consumers. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is getting lost with food waste?
                        <p>
                            The food item itself is getting wasted even though most of our current
                            food waste is edible (Food Waste Is a Massive Problem, 2020). 
                            The materials and resources used to grow the food is also getting
                            wasted such as water, gasoline, energy, labor, pesticides, land, 
                            and fertilizers (Sustainable Food Is Better for the Environmentâ€‹, 2013).

                    <li>
                        Who produces the most food waste?
                        <p>
                            The consumer level is where most of the food waste comes from. They 
                            account for 40%-50% of all food waste and it usually occurs in the 
                            home (Food Waste Is a Massive Problem, 2020)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How much food in America is getting thrown away?
                        <p>
                            According to the FDA, an estimated 30-40 percent of the food supply gets
                            discarded without ever being eaten. This is an estimation made from the
                            data they received of 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food
                            getting wasted in 2010. (Food Loss and Waste, 2020).

                    <li>
                        Where does food waste go and what happens to it?
                        <p>
                            Food waste usually ends up in landfills, which then start to produce methane,
                            a chemical that absorbs infrared radiation which leads to rise in temperatures
                            and a direct contributor on global warming and climate change (Beam, 2015).

                    </li>
                </ol>

                </p>
                <p>This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greenhouse gases from food waste in landfill</li>
                    <li>The majority of food waste is still edible, food insecurity in the USA could be erradicated</li>
                    <li> food waste also depletes environmental resources: water, gasoline, energy, labor, pesticides, land, and fertilizers</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Stakeholders
                </h4>
                <p>These are groups who are considered when we design our product. We considered everyone that could be affected
                    by the product we create. This'll give us a more holistic approach and inclusive design. The stakeholders include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Farmers</li>
                    <li>Grocery Stores</li>
                    <li>Environmentalists</li>
                    <li>Food industries</li>
                    <li>Residents</li>
                    <li>Sanitation workers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To see how all these stakeholders were connected and had an influence on food waste, I created a stakeholders map</p>
                <img src= "../img/stakeholder.png"/>
                <h4>
                    Context Study
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we conducted a few interviews with our stakeholders. My team and I conducted a interviews with users
                    listed above. I conducted one with my friend Vy, a 3rd year college student sharing an apartment with 1 roommate.
                    If you want to learn more about the interview, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q0bqHzIdPsq0uY-DJTAhtkvPft2abLBqDbedK83rMXY/edit">click here</a>. 
                    But some of the big takeaways from conducting these interviews include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To minimize food waste, one could try meal planning</li>
                    <li>Know your fridge, and have a plan for what you'll do with the items</li>
                    <li>Be creative with leftovers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For a short overview of my interview with Vy, below is a video highlighting the big takeaways</p>

                <h2>Our Project: Frodge</h2>
                <p>After ideating and coming up with a bunch of ideas, we chose our most promising idea.
                   We did this by weighing the pros and cons of each idea and seeing which best solves our problem space.
                   In the end, we chose Frodge, a smart fridge that'll help users minmize food waste.  
                </p>
                <h4>Ideas + components</h4>
                <p>For the components in the fridge, we decided to go big and ideate on features we thought would be impactful. So 
                   included in the inital proof-of-concept, we have a food monitoring system, trash receptical, alert system, and an intuitive
                   panel for the fridge to interact with the user. Some of these ideas are very futuristic, so we did some subsitutions
                   and hand waving components in our intial prototype. Below is our video. 
                </p>

                 allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <h4>User Feedback and evaluation</h4>
                <p>After creating our intial prototype, we planned to do a few user evaluations. I did one with my mother 
                    to learn a little more about how she would respond to our alert system. I did a behaviorial analysis and interview
                    with her to see how she would respond and whether it works. After the interview, I asked her questions on why she did
                    what she did during the behaviorial analysis. Afterwards, I walked her through some of our designs and asked for
                    her opinion on a few features</p>
                <p>From doing this, we learned a few painpoints in our original idea:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Screen panel's layout and orientation was cluncky and difficult to navigate</li>
                    <li>The alert system's text notification was sucessful and works well</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Final prototype</h4>
                <p>From the user feedback and a redesign of our plans, we created a second iteration and made improvements for a more 
                    user centered prototype. The following is our final prototype: 
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was my first time going through the design process, so it was a little difficult in the beginning. But I
                    am really proud of the work I did with my team. We learned a lot, created something meaningful, and learned the design process.
                    It requires a lot of user-focused work which I was not prepared for. But as we kept getting user feedback, our designs got better
                    and user-focused.
